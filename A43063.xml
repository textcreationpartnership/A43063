         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> having converted many of theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, draws an Argument from thence, to perſuade theſe new Diſciples to leave their old Vices, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. While they were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be ſlaves to their Luſts and Follies, might come from the Lewdneſs of their Pagan Religion, which many times did allow them, and ſometimes made them parts of their Devotion; or from the darkneſs of their minds about the nature of God, and the Rewards and Puniſhments after death, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.19. For when the great <hi>Diana</hi> was their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, they thought it pure Religion to imitate her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they were nothing elſe but folly and lewdneſs, and deem'd it true Devotion to draw her Pictures, and make Shrines for them; but now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. you have left the foppiſh and Idolatrous Service of <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple, and are baptiz'd into the Chriſtian Religion, which is plainly evidenc't to be Divine, her Precepts to be wiſe and good, and Rewards infinite: for you to live the lives of Pagans ſtill, to change your Temples but not your Minds, is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42078:3"/>like the madneſs of <hi>Diana's</hi> rout, the greateſt part knew not for what end they were met together; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your zeal and noiſe for Chriſtianity, you know not what that Religion means, and therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. tells his Chriſtian Diſciples, <hi>that they had not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> that they had been well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Religion was Spiritual and Divine, that it taught and perſuaded a change of their vicious nature, and the renovation of their mind and temper, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Follies that hitherto they were guilty of, they muſt now follow Truth and Honeſty, Meekneſs and Charity, all ſorts of Virtue and Goodneſs, which would far out-ſhine <hi>Diana</hi> and her Temples in all their glory; theſe Graces being the perfection of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hugely beneficial to mankind, the Image of God enſtamp't upon them, and the proper qualifications for the Divine ſtate of Heaven; and, among the reſt, he principally recommends the Virtues in my Text, which are the eaſe of Humane nature, the glew of Societies and Converſation, the beſt imitation of God and Chriſt, and the fineſt Livery and Ornament of a Chriſtian, <hi>And be ye kind one to another,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Three great Duties or Virtues are commanded;
<list>
                  <item>1. Kindneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. Tender-heartedneſs.</item>
                  <item>3. Readineſs to forgive.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Patern to do all this by, and the reaſon of it, <hi>even as God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though theſe three Duties are many times promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly us'd, and put one for another, yet they have different relations and reſpects, and may be fairly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd one from another, and ſeem to be rang'd and ſet in oppoſition to the contrary Vices of Anger and Wrath, Bitterneſs and Clamour, evil Speaking and Malice, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. As therefore Kindneſs is contrary to Bitterneſs or ill nature, it may expreſs it ſelf in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42078:3"/>
            <p n="1">1. In pleaſantneſs and eaſineſs of Converſation, in ſweetneſs of Diſpoſition, and a courteous and obliging temper. The true Chriſtian is not moroſe and ſullen, but if any indifferent Cuſtom or Uſage of Life will pleaſe his Neighbour, he is ready to comply: if Age, or Temper, or other circumſtance of Life, will not permit him in ſome things to do as his fellow Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth, yet he is not cenſorious, calling that a mortal Sin, which God hath allow'd for a liberty of Life: if he loves Retirement, yet he condemns not Society, and a more open Converſation, for a Vice: if he be not gay, he is not peeviſh, if of a grave deportment, yet not rough and ſour, and hath been better taught, than to call that common and unclean which God hath cleans'd, and infringe the freedom of Mankind. He is of ſo generous a temper, as to become all things to all men in the natural liberties of Life, ſo as to pluck up the Briars and Thorns which <hi>Adam</hi> ſow'd, eaſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burthens of this World, and ſweeten the bitter thoughts of men ariſing from the condition of mortal Life; that man is not always religious when he is ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len or Melancholy. Chriſtianity never bid its Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to dwell, like the; Spirit in the Goſpel, always among the Tombs; This is Superſtition only, which is no mote true Religion, than to be out of our Wits is to be Wiſe, and a falſe conception of God, that thinks him a ſullen and peeviſh Being, and makes his Servants ſuch, thinking it Perfection to imitate ſuch a God, as though he was diſpleas'd and angry with the little diverſions and pleaſures of Humane Life, <note place="margin">I <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.26.</note> 
               <hi>when the Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> So kind, ſo bountiful a Being do we Chriſtians ſerve, who plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in a Paradiſe, not a Deſart, and therefore to live thankfully to him, and with eaſe to our ſelves. When we have made our Sacrifice of Faith and Love, our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42078:4"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42078:5"/>Prayers and Devotion unto God, he then is pleas'd, and hath left all the World with its variety beſides, to be enjoy'd by the diſcreet and ſober Chriſtian: the beſt men have the greateſt reaſon to be cheerful and pleaſant. Our Saviour deny'd not his preſence to the Solemnity of a Marriage-Feaſt; and <hi>Socrates</hi> upon his Reed is not ſo fantaſtical a ſight, as is the ſullen and moroſe Chriſtian, who frights men from Religion, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when they muſt become good, they muſt leave all the little diverſions of Life, and ever after be black and melancholy in their minds. Thus to be kind, is not only our Convenience, but our Duty, we being oblig'd by our Religion to go out of our ſelves, and do all thoſe things which may better the condition of the World, and make men more happy. And what doth more promote that, than ſuch a temper as this, which knows how innocently to yield, and comply in the natural Liberties and lawful Freedoms of Life. The contrary Diſpoſition uſually carries with it the Spiritual ſins of Uncharitableneſs, Arrogance and Pride. There was more pride in the Cynick's trampling upon the Philoſopher's Carpets, than the Learned and Good man had in the Uſe of them; while the kind man in this ſence is humble and charitable, the ſalt and delight of all Society: and when Chriſt taught his Diſciples the Chriſtian Religion, he did not deſtroy Humanity, but made it a great Duty in it; and men that are ever ſullen and moroſe, have as little Religion as they have Manhood in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a generous temper, ready and free to do good. Such a man knows, he is not born for himſelf, that his Strength, Riches, Wiſdom, and other Abilities and Endowments of Nature, are not only to ſerve their Maſter; but his King, Countrey, Parents, Friends, Neighbours, and all Mankind may juſtly challenge a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42078:5"/>ſhare in them. He is not to be a dark Lanthorn, and only ſhine to himſelf, his Counſel is to direct the Paths of the Simple, his Power to relieve the oppreſs'd, and his Abundance to ſupply the Poor, he being only a Truſtee of God and Nature's Gifts; and if he uſe them not to the Benefit of others, is not only uncharitable, but Unjuſt. The man that is thus kind, perfects his own Nature, creates himſelf Pleaſures beyond thoſe of an Epicure, and lays the greateſt Obligations upon others, (his former goodneſs being his ſtore) againſt all the ſad changes of Times and Fortune. If Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are called Gods for their Authority and Power, good men may merit more that Title, nothing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that infinite Being better, than a Soul univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally bent to do good. 'Tis the delight of that immenſe Being, the joy of Angels, and the great Ingredient to the Happineſs of glorify'd Souls above. It ſeems to be the top and Sum of all the great Characters of our dear Lord, that he <hi>went about doing good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.38.</note> 'Tis a ſad account that ſome of his pretended Servants are to make when they come to dye, only to tell the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their merry Meetings, what Poſſeſſions they leave behind by their Care and Induſtry; not what naked Bodies they have cloath'd, what hungry Jaws they have fed, what Differences they have compos'd, what publick Dangers and Broils they have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what Errours they have reclaim'd; but they ate and drank; and as they came, ſo now they are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a Circle, and returning to their Mother Earth again; and becauſe they hid their Talent in the Earth, us'd the Goodneſs of God only to their own ſenſual Intereſt, deſerve to be condemn'd thither to ſleep for ever; and 'twas well if ſo, but a ſeverer doom follows them, paſs'd by their Lord and Judge, <hi>Begone into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery, ye workers of iniquity; for I know you not.</hi> If
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42078:6"/>
               <hi>Antoninus</hi> told the Senate right, that he had loſt a day when he had done no good, many, in the ſence of that Noble Heathen, have liv'd, only to loſe their Lives; they have exiſted only, the Chriſtian Life not being meaſur'd by number of years, but by Virtue and Goodneſs that doth attend it, and he ill merits the name of Chriſtian, who only pleaſeth himſelf with the Title and Priviledges, the cheap and eaſie parts of Chriſtianity, but diſplays it not in ſolid and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Acts, in doing good. The true Chriſtian is not ſtingy and narrow, confining his kindneſs to his Friends, and his Party, but, like his God, makes his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall upon the Juſt and Unjuſt, though eſpecially the Houſhold of Faith, yet the Dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from his Table, thoſe that are in the right, and thoſe that are out of the way, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> in ſome degree all mankind taſte of his Goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In abſtaining from rigours, and refuſing advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which Humane Laws may give him. In making of Laws, principal regard is had unto the Community, and many times particular Perſons ſuffer by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt. The good man will not entertain that advantage which the rigour of ſuch Laws do give him, but charitably conſiders, that 'tis beſide the intention of the Law-maker, and proceeds from the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Laws, and circumſtances of Humane Affairs. The Intention of the Law may be otherwiſe, yet Fraud, Ignorance, an imperfect judgment of things to come, Accidents, and breach of Confidence, may pervert it. The kind man therefore ſets up a Chancery in his own Breaſt, and deſires to be called not only Juſt but Good, and thinks <hi>Joſeph</hi> an excellent Pattern for his imitation, who, being a good man, merciful, full of humanity and clemency, would not, as the Law gave him leave,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42078:6"/>make a publick Example of the holy <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuſpected by him to be unfaithful to her Vow, but only deſign'd a private diſmiſſion; and knows that this is the beſt Character of the beſt of men, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah, Job</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. And a ſignal Favour and Reward many times attends him, that whereas for a righteous man, a man of Legal Juſtice only, few or none will venture death to ſerve him, <hi>but for a good man,</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7.</note> 
               <hi>ſome will even dare to dye.</hi> This obligation to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Equity, was antecedent to any right that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws could give him, being commanded by God, and enſtamp'd upon his Nature when he was born; and if the Law will abſolve him from Injuſtice, yet it will not from Unequitableneſs and Inhumanity. The man of rigour and ſeverity is pleas'd with advantages that the Law may give him, having a colour to violate the eternal Laws of Nature, under the protection of a Temporary Law of Man, which was only ſhort-ſighted, and when it aim'd at a common good, never deſign'd a particular miſchief; but when that happen'd beyond the meaning of that Law, it ſuppos'd the Laws of Nature and Chriſtianity in every mans breaſt would relieve his fellow Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Duty in the Text is Tender-heartedneſs, which conſiſts of theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In being extreamly ſenſible of the common trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and miſeries of our Chriſtian Brethren; this is the ſpring and original, the proper Source and cauſe of our Charity and Meekneſs, our Love and Relief of our fellow Beings. When our tempers are ſoft and ſenſible, and eaſily receive impreſſions from the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of others, we are pain'd within, and to eaſe our ſelves, we are ready to ſuccour them, and then Nature diſcharging her Burthen and Oppreſſion, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates both her own pleaſure and ſatisfaction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42078:7"/>her Duty. The multitude of miſerable Perſons will not upon this account produce a continued trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in your breaſt, for if the generality of mankind had this fellow-feeling, it would leſſen the number; and as it is, the pleaſure of doing good far ſurpaſſeth the pain in pittying, which is the objection againſt commiſeration: if I may call it pain, or rather the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural delight of a good and generous mind; for there is pity and compaſſion in Heaven, in the breaſt of the bleſſed Jeſus toward his diſtreſſed Members here, yet where no pain can dwell: this Temper is therefore to imitate the beſt of Natures above, conſiſtent with our happineſs, or is part of it there, and the Ornament and Beauty of our Soul here, founded in Nature, and perfected by the Divine Spirit, and may juſtly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of its chiefeſt Graces, and he that wants it, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be a man and a Chriſtian at the ſame time. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8, 9.</note> When therefore <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had put off his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and pity, ſhewing no mercy to the diſtreſs'd, he ſuitably put on the ſhape of that without, which he was within, being degraded from a Man and King, and, like a Beaſt, graz'd ſo long, till he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27.</note> that the Heavens did rule, and ſhew'd mercy to the Poor, that he ſo cruelly had oppreſs'd. The Prieſt and the Levite who boaſted of their Knowledg, their Oracles, and Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet paſsd by, and diſregarded the ſtrip'd and wounded Stranger in their way, ſhew'd their Religion was but Faction and Hypocriſie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.34.</note> while the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd and poured in Oyl, though he had not ſo good a Temple, had more of God. Many times God ſends Calamities upon men, to ſoften their hard temper, that by experience they might learn to ſuccour others in their diſtreſs. And very often ſevere, yet ſuitable Judgments have purſued the cruel and unmerciful.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42078:7"/>Twas the fate of <hi>Agag,</hi> becauſe his Sword had <hi>made women childleſs,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.33.</note> his Mother now ſhould be ſo by his Death;</hi> and becauſe he never gave, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no mercy. 'Tis one great thing to the making of a Devil, <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that Prince of Flys, who is ſo far from pittying, he laughs at, and feaſts upon the ſores, the miſeries of Mankind. Such that have hearts rejoycing in miſchief, ſurpaſſing the hardneſs of Rocks, who can ſtand at ſhoar and with pleaſure ſee others wrack't, and drown'd by ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, who can warm their hands at their Neighbours fires, and be as pleaſant, as <hi>Nero</hi> was, upon the ſame occaſion, who from ſmaller beginnings of cruelty, in being delighted to rip up, and ſee the panting hearts of Leverets, came at laſt to do the ſame unto his Mother. This is to be a Fiend, and to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Vice may men arrive. God, to keep this Vice at the greateſt diſtance, forbad <hi>David</hi> to build his Temple, becauſe he had been concern'd in Wars and Blood: and the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, would not permit an Executioner to offer any thing to the Sanctuary. <note place="margin">Ham. in Mat. <hi>27.</hi>
               </note> And we Chriſtians have thus learn'd Chriſt, he having taught us, that when upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our fellow Chriſtians ſhall be full of tears and ſorrow for the croſſes and ſad accidents of Life, that we ſhould put on a ſuitable temper, having a fellow-feeling, to weep with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn, that we may help them in their miſery and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In being ready to help them out of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by all the juſt means we can. Without this, our former pity is but an idle paſſion, and ſerves only to upbraid their miſery, and diſturb our ſelves. To view the naked and the deſtitute with Tears only,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42078:8"/>and fruitleſs wiſhes, that ſome kind hand would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a Raiment upon them, ſerves only to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a dead from a living Faith. For ſuch men there are, whoſe Nature and Religion prompts them to pity and commiſeration, yet Covetouſneſs or expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Vanities check the good inclination. When Sports or Paſtimes, and the inſtruments of them, an Horſe, or a Dog, ſhall have the preference of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Chriſtian, and he ſhall ſearce live, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is pamper'd; when in the times of Dearth and Scarceneſs, the plump Epicure feaſts and ſurfeits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while the poor Chriſtian for want dyes in the common Streets, at beſt, in common with his Dogs; he gives him only a few crumbs from his Table, to eaſe himſelf, the pityable object diſturbing his Pleaſure. The Covetous, whoſe Barns are full, and Stores plentiful, out of an unjuſt ſuſpicion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſome time or other he ſhall want theſe, or from an unaccountable and ſilly fancy of having much, and dying rich, keeps this abundance only to ſerve Ruſt and Mice, while his fellow Chriſtian groans for want, and dyes unreliev'd. When Schiſms rend the Church, and Factions the State, when Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods and Societies are torn in pieces by ſtrifes and Contentions, yet the jolly Gallio cares for none of theſe. Fear in ſome, Covetouſneſs in others, hopes of Advantage, and Idleneſs and Softneſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, make theſe ſad things look as indifferent and little, as the buzzings and quarrels of Waſps and Bees about a Flower. A melting paſſion for other mens miſery, is no diſcharge of our Duty, till real Actions follow, and we become eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, give our counſel to the ſimple, our ſtrength to the oppreſſed, our purſe to the indigent,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42078:8"/>and we become the common Granaries and ſupplies to the poor and weak: who can challenge theſe good things of us by the right of Nature, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Religion, the Deſign of our Plenty; but when we ſimply pity but not relieve, the ſincerity of our Faith is juſtly queſtion'd. When we hate our Brethren whom we have ſeen, (for that is hatred of them with God, to deny them Relief when we can give it) with whom we are joyn'd in the common neceſſities of Nature, and a more familiar Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and only magnifie God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20.</note> whom we have not ſeen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, pretending deeper myſtery and knowledge of him, and paſſion for him, our Love and Religion towards him turns into Hypocriſie and Falſeneſs, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm or Carnality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Gentleneſs when we puniſh. The ſturdy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, not to be drawn by the bands of Love, hath made Puniſhments abſolutely neceſſary to Rule and Government, without which, Laws would be but Formalities and Entreaties: and therefore God himſelf, and the wiſeſt Governours, have arm'd their Laws with the greateſt terrours, to affright the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory into Obedience; not onely to be Scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows of Power, but to be really inflicted by the hands of Juſtice, where Mercy will not take place; but where abatements of puniſhment will ſerve the end, <hi>viz.</hi> preſerve Government, and cauſe Repentance, God and good men have never us'd utmoſt ſeverity and deſtruction, which are due onely to the refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and impenitent, and are rarely executed; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are, to make wholſome Preſidents and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to terrifie, and are good Land-marks to keep others from ſplitting upon the ſame Rocks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying themſelves. Utmoſt rigors many times loſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42078:9"/>the end of Puniſhment, making men deſperate; alwayes ſcourging drives away Modeſty, begets a brawny and a ſenſleſs temper, which will run away with its Rider, and contemns its unmerciful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; who, while he endeavours to reform ſome ſort of Vice in others, by ſuch ſevere Methods, he begets and cheriſheth another ſort of Vice in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Unmercifulneſs being as great a Vice as any. Far unlike to the temper of Jeſus, whoſe Perſon and Authority, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo maliciouſly contemned and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecuted, who would have accepted of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for their Blaſphemy and Diſobedience, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a Reprieve; and when their ſturdy Malice againſt him fore'd him to a ſentence, he did it like the good Emperour, (only in an higher degree) with Tears, and felt thoſe Pains and Sorrows for them, which they would not feel for themſelves. Juſtice it ſelf only there takes place, where Mercy could not; much leſs muſt rigorous Execution be us'd, when lighter Chaſtiſements and ſofter Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will reclaim the Offender. As Magiſtrates are called Gods, ſo in this they muſt be like God, who, when he goes to take Vengeance of his Enemies, (the Divine Government calling for a particular inſtance of ſeverity) is ſaid to riſe out of his place, and do a Work ſtrange to his Nature, <note place="margin">Na. 26.21.28.21.</note> Mercy and Forgiveneſs, Lenity and Longanimity being his delight, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the diſtribution of Charity and Alms, and providing for the neceſſities of the Poor, tender-heartedneſs being the natural Spring from whence it doth ariſe. Of all the Duties in the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none carry ſo many Arguments with them to enforce their Practice, as this. 'Tis a Duty of an eaſie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42078:9"/>performance, Charity not being confin'd to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches and Hoſpitals, and other expenſive Inſtances, but expreſſeth it ſelf, in good Counſel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Prayers, good Reports, and the like, which the great and rich in Honour may receive, and the poor can, and ought to give. Charity is but reverence which we owe to our common Nature, the Poor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image and Superſcription enſtamp'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and we may ſay of them as <hi>Seneca</hi> did of Servants; <hi>Servi ſunt, imo homines, ſervi ſunt, imo contubernales, ſervi ſunt, imo humiles amici, ſervi ſunt, imo conſervi:</hi> in ſuch near relation they ſtand to the God of Heaven, our common Parent. 'Tis a debt that we owe them, and when we pay it not, we are unrighteous and unjuſt. Under the rigid Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and among the <hi>Jews,</hi> a People given to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Exaction, how careful, how bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was Divine Providence, when he gave them Laws, to provide for the diſtreſſed and poor. And under the new Diſpenſation to recommend the Duty. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the charitable is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man. To make the Duty honourable and great, God takes the Charity done to one of his poor as done to himſelf; and as he is pleas'd to accept it, we are put in a capacity of obliging him, who gave us all that we enjoy. Upon this account, we more eminently lay up Treaſure in Heaven, and by filling the poor mans Box here, we become Heirs to the many Manſions in our Fathers houſe. In nothing more we imitate that mighty Being above, to whom, all Creatures, cloth'd in their different Liveries, put up their cryes and groans for the Penſions and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heaven, and God's the Almoner there; then in being Stewards to his good things, the plenty of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42078:10"/>Earth, we freely make diſtribution of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the wants of others. Otherwiſe we forfeit the great end of Temporal Bleſſings, having an happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good to others, and to procure a Bleſſing upon our ſelves. For beſides the Rewards above, and the Proviſions we make to our ſelves here from the grateful poor, who are many times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to a better condition, when the Changes and Revolutions in the World may wheel us about into lower and meaner circumſtances of Life, what ſtrange Deliverances and unexpected Supplies, new Friends and ſecret Helps, in a ſilent and inviſible way, have followed our former Charity. But what need I? I muſt not urge any more Arguments to enforce the practice of this mighty Duty to this Auditory, which hath ſo often heard them upon this occaſion, and ſo well have practis'd them. The Charity that this Ancient and Renowned City, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Members of it, have ſhewn, in various inſtances, and numerous expreſſions of it, hath told the Pagan World, what a beneficial thing true Chriſtianity is to mankind, confuted the Scandal caſt upon our Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> by her Adverſaries, that our Religion conſiſts only in Faith and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but doing no good Works; it hath added luſtre to your Names and City; you have wip'd away the Tears, and ſtill'd the Groans of the poor and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, chang'd their Curſes into Prayers, and all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations ſhall call you bleſſed. And therefore I do not ſo much exhort as praiſe, and give our saviours bleſſing to you, <note place="margin">Matth. 24.46.</note>

            <p>The third Duty in the Text is readineſs to forgive; which may expreſs it ſelf in theſe following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though we be the offended, yet to ſeek peace with the offending Party; a Principle of Peace and Charity will be naturally acting, and travels with pain to it ſelf, till it bring forth the fruits of Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; ſuch good nature is not at eaſe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with it ſelf, not becauſe it hath received an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, but becauſe the pleaſant exerciſe of mutual Love and Friendſhip is ſtopt, and therefore labours firſt, to remove the dirt and rubbiſh that damm'd it up, that it might flow again in its gentle ſtream; To ſeek Peace, is far from being a ſign of a mean and Abject Spirit, that 'tis imitating the greateſt, moſt infinite Being, God, who intreats his Enemies to be reconcil'd, and when the prodigal Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſcorned their Father and his Houſe before, are at diſtance, he runs out, meets them in their return, and prevents them with his Pardon and Love: And many times the brave and the generous, the Prince and the Conquerour have ſent out their Pardons, before the Rebel hath laid down his Arms. The offending Party ſometimes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42078:11"/>out of ignorance of your good Nature, or becauſe he is an ill man, thinks no injur'd Perſon can be heartily reconcil'd, but is ſmooth'd over only for a time, while 'tis his Intereſt and better Opportunity of Revenge (which is a ſtrange imputation to Humane Nature and Chriſtian Religion) and therefore out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Peace, continues in a State of War with you; by ſeeking Peace, you undeceive his Error, you heap Coals of Fire upon his Head, melting him down into ſoftneſs and repentance, he is more aſham'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at his Fault and miſtake; you humble him more by your Mercy than Severity, your kindneſs takes Revenge, your Reputation is the fairer, and 'tis your Intereſt, you gaining that by this eaſie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which might poſſibly have been loſt by a more tedious and troubleſome way of Pride and Rigor: there are indeed croſs Tempers in the World, which grow harder by your yielding, and run back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becauſe you are coming on, but for the reſpect of Mankind, I hope theſe are not many, and the worſt of them are mollified in ſome degree, thoſe that are not, ill deſerve the name and ſhape they bear, and will not excuſe in the general this Duty of being forward and zealous to forgive, and make Peace, which is our Honour and Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt not ſtick upon too difficult terms of Reconciliation, either above the Merit of the Fault, or always equal to it. Satisfaction by way of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above the Merit of the Crime, ſhows us rigid and unjuſt, and exceeds the Severity of the Moſaick-Law, which allowed only a Tooth for a Tooth but not an Eye for a Tooth, or an Head for an Eye in Compenſation by way of payment or profit, above
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42078:12"/>the Nature of the Fault, ſhews the Exactor of it is Coveteous and Cruel, and for Intereſt ſake rejoyceth in Evil, and is pleas'd with Offences becauſe of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and would unchriſtianly and meanly proſtitute-his Fame and Religion too, ſo he might gain by it; always to ſtick upon equal ſatisfactions, to have the Injury and Atonement weighed in nice Ballances, to come to Granes and Scruples, is far from being a good or benign Man, a merciful or Charitable Perſon, far from the Evangelical Temper, which reſts not in a dry and ſullen Juſtice, but ſoftens into Clemency and Grace. Government it ſelf and points of Honour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not the bounds of Juſtice; in reſenting Injuries, always, as near, as decently they can, they regard Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Mercy, much more private Perſons in their Circumſtances and Condition ought to do. Men of Rigour know not, or forget the Conſtitution of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who are tranſgreſſing one againſt another, and if Forgiveneſs or abatement of Puniſhment and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction did not take place, the World muſt turn into Confuſion, or nothing heard of, beſides Judges and Tribunals. Such a man is not always the wiſeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Retaliation for Injuries, and to retreive his Fame by the ſmarteſt Penalties, he provokes but the World to Wrath for the time of his offending; and if he clear his Reputation by ſuch hard Methods, he foyls it at the ſame time, meriting the Title of ſevere and Cruel, as great a reproach as any: while eaſie Conditions would gain his end as well. <hi>viz.</hi> Keep his Fame and advance it higher, giving him the Title of good and gracious, that God himſelf is pleas'd with; nothing being more inhumane, then, when Life or a plentiful way of living, a Chriſtians Fortune and his Peace are to be given in Campoſition to any implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42078:12"/>Perſon of private Circumſtances, for a trivial loſs, undecent carriage, or angry and paſſionate words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To do the offending Party any good. This is the height of Goodneſs, and by Chriſt is call'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and to this we have an obligation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the greatneſs of Rewards, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to ſo great a mind, but from our own act and the nature of Forgiveneſs. For where you intirely pardon, you reſtore the man into his former circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and condition, and if your Charity was due to him before, ſo 'tis now. Our Prudence and our Religion ſometimes bid us not be too credulous in thinking the repentance of the offending Party to be ſincere, nor too profuſe, without diſtinction in ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our Mercies, yet to be too ſevere in judging, is often Cruelty, and many times an hypocritical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſtop a merciful or a bountiful hand. Or to be too rigid about the after carriage of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as though hereafter he was to be impeccable, and expect no grace for common Errours and Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, this is Severity and Unmercifulneſs, and you are ſo far from pardoning, that you puniſh ſtill: for, before, he had the allowance of all mankind, but now you have taken it away: and is far from the kind dealings of God with Offenders, to whom, upon repentance, when he promiſes remiſſion of ſins, he means, not only you ſhall eſcape an Hell, <hi>non paſces in cruce corvos,</hi> but you ſhall enjoy an Heaven. To pretend to pardon, and when the opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great good to the Delinquent is come, then to deny him, is only delaying the Puniſhment to a more convenient ſeaſon, for a more heavy revenge. If your Mercy be miſplac'd and abus'd, it only aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates his Crime you pardon, but leſſons not your
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42078:13"/>Goodneſs, whoſe purpoſe was honeſt and great of doing well. It hath been the immortal honour of the great and brave, that they have not only forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Enemies, but advanc'd them, and many times it hath prov'd their Intereſt; candour and ſence of their Princes Goodneſs and their own Offences hath made them ſurer Friends and more faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 'Tis a Proverb that only fits the Vulgars Mouths who know how to forgive, but not to forget. The Mercies of the noble and truly Chriſtian are clean and large, not fetter'd with too many Conditions and Reſtrictions, endeavouring more to be generouſly good, then nicely wiſe; and though his Mercy ſhould not gain is excellent end to reclaim the Offender, yet 'tis the Perfection of his own Nature, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Pattern to do this by, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. <hi>Even as God, for Chriſts ſake, hath forgiven you.</hi> The obligation to this is ſtrong, if we conſider theſe two things.

                  <item>1. Our ſelves, or what we are. He knows not himſelf to be a man, who will not write himſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ignorant and perverſe, little and proud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and diſobedient, full of ſo many follies and baſeneſs, that here we want, ſhall I call it ill, or good and proper Language to expreſs his Character. His Body is compounded of the Elements common to the Bruits over whom he domineers, and ſcorns; ſubject to more Diſeaſes and greater filth; his better part, his Soul, the Image of God, is ſtrangely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and defac'd, and the worſe now, becauſe originally, ſo good, his carriage rude and ungrateful towards his Maker, cruel and inhumane towards his Fellows, ſuperſtitions in his Devotion, ſilly and falſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42078:13"/>in his Converſation; in ſhort, whatever is mean, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or imperfect, in ſome degree at leaſt, we may charge on man, he being prone to all theſe, and in a Paſſion may cry out, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> And which more ſhews what a ſtrange Being Man is, the eminent Kindneſs and Providence of God over him, makes him conceited, that he is a Being very great in himſelf, uſeful unto God, and merits this care at his hands. For ſuch a Being as this, that wants ſo much mercy, not to ſhew any, that receives ſo much bounty, not to give, that is ſupported and lives by the immenſe Love and Charity, to be envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cruel, confutes his pretence, that he is not the Image of God, he is only a clod of Earth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with Blood, <hi>lutum ſanguine maceratum,</hi> as was ſaid of one of the vileſt of the whole Creation. Should Malefactors in their Priſons upbraid one another with their Crimes, or deny their mutual Pardons for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed among themſelves, would it not tempt their Prince to deny them a reprieve; ſhould Slaves, Beggars and Hoſpitals, fall out and implead one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for wry Faces, undecent Words, and ſtand upon Terms of Honour and be implacable; would it not move laughter in the Beholder, and call for a laſh to diſcipline them into Meekneſs and Love among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Such Creatures are men, ill meriting that noble name, who for their Hatred and Malice, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Cruelty among themſelves, are as much laught at, and condemn'd by the great and knowing Spirits above, as we ſcorn Frogs and Lice, and other Vermin here. Our Prayers for pardon of Sin, are but confident Provocations, while we are Cruel and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Revenge; with what Brow can we expect that God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42078:14"/>ſhould every day forgive, when we ſometimes will not pardon a ſingle Offence all our Life. Do we not come to crucifie the Lord of Life again, and make him the daily boody Sacrifice, when we bring our Hatred and Malice, to that holy Board of Love and Charity. A Wolf to feaſt with a Lamb, and inſtead of making him an Atonement for our Sin, we make him the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Tyrants and men of Blood ſeldom dye dry Deaths, and the unmerciful, rarely find Mercy; and men of implacable Spirits, of Sowerneſs and Rigour, of Malice and Revenge, are moſt commonly hated and contemn'd by all, while they live, dye without a Tear, and are laugh'd unto their Graves. So it is our Intereſt and Reputation here, as well as our Religion and Heavens Reward hereafter, to be of a forgiving Temper.</item>
                  <item>2. The Nature of God and his Proceedings with Men, among all the imitable things of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture none are ſo fairly propos'd and recommended, as the long Suffering and Mercy of God, the frequency of its exerciſe, the abſolute Neceſſity of it for mankind, make it appear the moſt lovely among all his mighty Attributes, there being no ſort of men ſo good and circumſpect in their Demeanour here, but muſt daily beg the Divine Pardon and Mercy; the beſt of men have therefore thus humbled themſelves. <hi>Lord who knows how oft he offends, cleanſe thou me from my ſecret Faults,</hi> deſcribing theirs Sins with all their aggravating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of Number, Scandal, Preſumption, and the like, not for Rhetorick or Paſſion ſake, to make a tedious Prayer, but to make them truly ſenſible of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Forgiveneſs. He that knows not this, is the worſt of Men, having fin'd himſelf into Stupidity, and made his Condition deſperate. Shall not therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42078:14"/>the ſuperabundant Mercy of God, and his infinite patience towards Mankind, lead them into an imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Pitty, and forgive their offending Brother. 'Tis not the Nature of God <hi>willingly to grieve the Children of Men,</hi> and ſhall we pleaſe our ſelves with Severitys, be unconcern'd at common Calamities, and make Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon our Enemies, our pleaſure and paſtime, hath he not commanded us to forgive our Brethren till ſeventy times ſeven, and his Meroy is as far above ours as Heaven is from Earth, and ſo far removes our Sins froms us: Shall his Mercy retch unto the Heavens and his Truth unto the Clouds, and ſhall our kindneſs and bowels being only conſin'd to our little ſelves? We ſin, and God is provoked every day, and he puniſheth and lightly too once in an Age be being ſlow to Anger and of great Mercy, but we are quick with Revenge, uſurping the Priviledge of God, making Vengeance our own never forgiving, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not on a dying Bed, but perſuing the Memory and Ghoſt of our Enemy beyond the grave, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing Quarrels upon Poſterities beyond the third and fourth Generation, and contrary to the Mereies of God our. Anger endures for ever: Should our deſire of Revenge take place, Fire every day would be comming down from Heaven, and Plagues and Mildews would be as common as our Breath to deſtroy our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which in their ſeveral turns would almoſt be the Race of Mankind, till we exiſted alone, as troubleſome to our ſelves as to our fellows. Is not the Honour of God as great as ours, his Power as large, andweleſs ſerviceable to him than to one another? Had we been condemned to endleſs Miſeries upon our firſt Offence, or return'd to our former nothing, there had never been leſs joy in Heaven, there are infinite numbers of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42078:15"/>Spirits about his Throne, to praiſe his Name, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Will, or he could out of ſtones have rais'd up Children to magnifie the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyd himſelf in the ſame infinite manner before the World was, but becauſe he would be Merciful, he therefore would be Merciful, not compell'd by any necſſity from without or from within; and muſt our dealings and converſation in Rigors in Extremities with our fellow Chriſtians, of the ſame ſtamp of Nature and Religion with us, and ſo uſeful to us, be ſo far unlike to the Methods of this mighty Being? When we were Bankrupts, and had nothing to compound our Debts with Heaven, except God perfectly forgave all, which he ſo freely hath done, ought not we to pardon and relieve, to be eaſily reconcill'd, and Friends to thoſe that offend us? This Argument is ſo plain and ſo cogent, ſo uſeful to us and excellent in its Nature, that to add more would be to trifle, and therefore I ſhall conclude with St <hi>Paul</hi>'s enetreaty, <hi>If there be therefore any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Mercies, which give us</hi> ſo much praiſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Mind here and rewards hereafter: Think on theſe things, God Almighty grant it for the ſake of his Son; To whom be Glory and Praiſe both now and for evermore. Amen.</item>
